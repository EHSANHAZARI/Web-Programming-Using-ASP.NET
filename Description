What is this application ? 
I have been requested to build an app to serve the needs of companies in the music business. I will produce an app that will enable a record label to manage their artists, albums, and tracks.
the people who work at the record label have various responsibilities, roles, and job duties. You will focus on three job titles ,the roles are
Executive – Also known as an “artists & repertoire” (A&R) executive, manages the talent acquisition and management process.
Coordinator – Oversees or coordinates the work on an album, all aspects, and phases.
Clerk – Supports the coordinator and executive, during the time that the artist makes progress on an album.
